## Application Bot

A simple Discord bot I made to demonstrate my experience for the Discord Server Manager role at Identification of Music. Though the included information is now outdated, this bot is still live as of 13.10.23 for achival purposes.

### Usage

1. [Join my Discord testing server](https://discord.gg/mtf3vVBVyV)
2. Send message `/start` in the `#start-here` channel
3. Follow on-screen instructions

### FYI

This repository was built with Replit and uploaded to GitHub for demonstration purposes only. The fully functioning Repl can be found at the following link:

 Thanks!
